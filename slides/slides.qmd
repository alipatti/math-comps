## Outline

<!-- documentation: https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/beamer.html -->
<!-- TODO: finalize outline -->


- What is algebraic number theory?

. . .

- Field extensions, number fields, number rings

. . .

- The ideal class group

. . .

- Two big theorems
  - Ideal class groups are finite
  - Dirichlet's unit theorem

## Algebraic Number Theory?

::: {.incremental}

- *Algebraic* -- Uses tools from group, ring and field theory.

- *Number Theory* -- Studies the natural numbers, with emphasis on the primes.

## So what is a number field?

<!-- TODO: pick a polynomial -->

$$
f(x) = x^2 + 5
$$

This is irriducable over $\Q$, but it factors over $\C$:

$$
f(x) = (x - i \sqrt5)(x + i \sqrt5)
$$

But do we really need all of $\C$?

## So what is a number field?


$$
f(x) = x^2 + 5 = (x - i \sqrt5)(x + i \sqrt5)
$$
