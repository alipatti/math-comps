# An Introduction to Algebraic Number Theory

This talk will be a whirlwind introduction to the field of algebraic number
theory with the goal of stating and unpacking (but not proving!) two important
theorems: Dirichlet's unit Theorem and the finiteness of the ideal class group.
Along the way, we'll cover things like the algebraic integers, cyclomatic
fields, Dedekind domains, and generalizations of primes.
