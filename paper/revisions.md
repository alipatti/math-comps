# Revisions

Overall, what you've written is easy to follow and accurate. We have a few
specific corrections and clarifications suggested below. Our main general
request is that you include a section that states the Dirichlet Unit Theorem and
gives an illustration or two (for instance, for number fields of degree 2).
While we agree that you don't have space to give a proof of the unit theorem, it
is a part of your comps prompt and should be addressed in your paper.

- [x] state unit theorem
- [x] unpack in specific case of quadratic fields

Specific comments and corrections:

- [x] p.2, line following equation (5): what does it mean for two elements of
      Z[i] to be relatively prime?

- [x] p.2, second to last line: it's not true that a and b relatively prime
      ensure the generated triple is primitive. Please correct.

- [x] p.4, 3 lines from end: make clear that the p in this sentence is a prime
      integer.

- [x] p.4, last line: this suggests that there is a notion of "prime element" in
      a general ring (not just in the integers). Please define what that notion
      is.

- [x] p. 5, Definition 2.10: This definition needs to involve a unit in R. Also,
      the uniqueness is not absolute -- it is only up to re-ordering. Please
      correct.

- [x] p.6, Theorem 2.13, part (iii), specify that I is an ideal in S.

- [x] p.7, Definition 2.15: It's not clear where the alpha_i live. For a finite
      extension of Q, there is a natural large field containing it, namely C,
      and one often assumes the alpha_i are in C. In general one usually assumes
      that the alpha_i belongs to some fixed field containing K, usually an
      algebraic closure of K.

- [x] p.7, Theorem 3.2: the word irreducible is missing in this definition.

- [x] p.10, Definition 4.2: this is a highly original explanation for the use of
      the script O!

- [x] p.10, lines following equation (23): specify what n is here.

- [x] p.11, third line after equation (24): the phrase "finite integral basis"
      doesn't have a clear meaning here. A more precise phrase would be "is a
      finitely generated Z-module"

- [x] p.13, Lemma 4.7.1: the notion of prime element of a ring hasn't been
      clearly defined (see one of our previous comments).

- [x] p.16, Lemma 5.4.1: please define the ideal norm

- [x] p. 17, Lemma 5.4.2: two typos in the first two lines of the proof.

- [x] p.17, Lemma 5.4.3: say why the second equality in (45) holds.

- [x] p.17, Lemma 5.4.3: say why there are only finitely many prime ideals of
      norm less than a fixed bound. You might start by fixing a prime integer p
      and saying why there are only finitely many prime ideals whose norm is any
      power of p.
