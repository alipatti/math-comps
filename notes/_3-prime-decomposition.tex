\section{Prime Decompositions}

\begin{definition}[Integral]
	Let $S \subseteq R$ be rings with $\alpha \in R$. Then, $b$ is \textit{integral} over $S$ if there exists a monic $f \in S[x]$ such that $f(\alpha) = 0$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Dedekind domain]
	A \textit{Dedekind domain} is an integral domain $R$ such that
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item every ideal is finitely generated,
		\item every nonzero prime ideal is maximal,
		\item $R$ is integrally closed in its fraction field $K = \{ \sfrac a b : a, b \in R, b \neq 0 \}$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

% TODO: why is dedekind domain something we want? how does it relate to UFDs, PIDs?

\begin{theorem}
	Number rings are Dedekind domains.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
	For all ideals $I$ of a Dedekind domain $R$, there exists an ideal $J \subset R$ such that $IJ$ is principal.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corrolary}
	With chapter 1, exercise 32, this implies that the ideal class group is a group.
\end{corrolary}

\begin{corrolary}
	If $A$ and $B$ are ideals, then $A \mid B$ iff $A \supset B$.
\end{corrolary}

\begin{theorem}[Unique factorization]
	Every ideal in a Dedekind domain $R$ uniquely factors into primes ideals.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Every Dedekind ideal is generated by two elements]
	Let $I$ be an ideal of a Dedekind domain $R$ and let $\alpha \in R$ be arbitrary. Then, there exists a $\beta \in R$ such that $R = (\alpha, \beta)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
	A Dedekind domain is a UFD iff it's a PFD.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
	Let $K \subset L$ be fields and $P \subset R = \mathcal O_K$ and $Q \subset S = \mathcal O_L$ be prime ideals of their corresponding number rings. Then, the following are equivalent
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $Q \mid PS$,
		\item $Q \supset PS$,
		\item $Q \supset P$,
		\item $Q \cap R = P$,
		\item $Q \cap K = P$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
